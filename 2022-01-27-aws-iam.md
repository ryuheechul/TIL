## Background
I have some experience with AWS in the past. But the most recent Cloud Platform experience for me was with GCP.

Terms and concepts in AWS of course confused me since it is quite different from those of GCP, thus I spent a little time relearning them and leaving a note here.


## My take on terms/concepts
> also read https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html for official explanations.

### (IAM) User
It's an identity that can either be for humans or applications (bot) or both. Sharing this identity is a bad practice though since it makes it hard to track who's using it.
If it's only intended to use via (web) console, don't issue access/secret key pairs. If it's only intended to use via CLI, the password is probably not necessary.

### Role
This is like a hat or a wearable if you will. Look inside the hat, it describes one or many permissions via policies.

### Group
This allows you to avoid granting the same permissions to multiple users individually. Instead, you grant permissions just to a group and add users to that when it makes sense.

### Policy
It is a "certificate" when it's in an inline form and a template for the certificate when it's a generated one. Nonetheless, policies can be attached to IAM identities like User, Role, Group.
Attaching policies is basically what you do to grant permissions in the AWS IAM world.
A policy can be very complex as it's flexible and provides many options.

### Action
This is the details of each permission that will be listed in a Policy.


## What are example cases?

An identity (User, Role, Group) can directly attach (inline) policy describing what actions can (or can't) be performed.

But that inline policy is not reusable, so you might instead generate a managed policy that is referrable and reusable.

Identities also can assume roles, read https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html as some things are not super clear to me yet.

Also, a service like EC2 instance can assume the role and be given temporary credentials that you can pass along to a process like your python app for example.

An application should think about the possibility of assuming Roles like the case above with EC2 instance first.
If that's not feasible, a User can be issued and used as a bot account with care (since AWS doesn't draw a line between human and bot account for you).
