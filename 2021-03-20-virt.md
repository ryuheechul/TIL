## Background

My knowledge of virtualization is minimal.

But I have user-level experiences with these:
VirtualBox
VMWare Fusion
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
[Multipass](https://multipass.run/)

And I just discovered these recently:
https://github.com/weaveworks/footloose
https://ignite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox
https://libvirt.org/
https://www.naut.ca/blog/2020/08/26/ubuntu-vm-on-macos-with-libvirt-qemu/
_with a hope that I can replicate WSL2 on mac maybe_

And as usual, one yak shaving to another I ended up being curious about `DISPLAY` environment variable.

## Access virtual machine graphically for the first time

OK, I'm not gonna lie. I actually did this before via Virtualbox.
But this is still different because I didn't really know how that works.

I mean I don't know that really yet but I'm at least a bit closer.

with a help of this, https://askubuntu.com/a/25192

I was able to access my multipass VM via Â a VNC client

in macOS host

```
multipass start
multipass sh
```

in multipass guest

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xvfb
sudo apt install x11vnc
 
sudo x11vnc -create
```

in macOS host
```
brew install vnc-viewer --cask
multipass info --all    # to get the ip of guest
open /Applications/VNC\ Viewer.app
# enter the ip in "VNC Viewer.app"
```

Boom, now you access the guest via a ghaphical way even though that is still a terminal in this case.

It's logged in as `root` though. And I can `su multipass` of course. 

I typed `printenv DISPLAY` and the value was `:20`.

I closed the VNC Viewer and also stopped `x11vnc` in guest. I started `x11vnc` again and accessed it via VNC Viewer again.

It was not a new terminal but the screen was just at where I was left off including the cursor. I guess it's just the same experience as if I closed remote desktop connection and accessed again.

That was something new I learned today.
