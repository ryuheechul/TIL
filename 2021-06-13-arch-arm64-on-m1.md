## Background

I've been wanting to run Linux on M1 (aka Apple Silicon) MacBook.

There are several options I could find but I chose this option below.

https://gist.github.com/akihikodaki/87df4149e7ca87f18dc56807ec5a1bc5

Although I don't understand the all the details but that sounds like a great work.

And fortunately there is homebrew version as well, https://github.com/knazarov/homebrew-qemu-virgl.

And I made a Makefile below that basically doing the same as the repo above as of writing this note.

```Makefile
.PHONY: run
run:
	qemu-system-aarch64 \
		-machine virt,accel=hvf,highmem=off \
		-cpu cortex-a72 -smp 2 -m 4G \
		-device intel-hda -device hda-output \
		-device virtio-gpu-pci \
		-device virtio-keyboard-pci \
		-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net \
		-device virtio-mouse-pci \
		-display cocoa,gl=es \
		-netdev user,id=net,ipv6=off \
		-drive "if=pflash,format=raw,file=./edk2-aarch64-code.fd,readonly=on" \
		-drive "if=pflash,format=raw,file=./edk2-arm-vars.fd,discard=on" \
		-drive "if=virtio,format=raw,file=./hdd.raw,discard=on"

.PHONY: install
install: prepare
	qemu-system-aarch64 \
		-machine virt,accel=hvf,highmem=off \
		-cpu cortex-a72 -smp 2 -m 4G \

		-drive "if=virtio,format=raw,file=./hdd.raw,discard=on" \
		-cdrom focal-desktop-arm64.iso \
		-boot d

.PHONY: prepare
prepare: hdd.raw focal-desktop-arm64.iso
	cp $(shell dirname $(shell which qemu-img))/../share/qemu/edk2-aarch64-code.fd .
	cp $(shell dirname $(shell which qemu-img))/../share/qemu/edk2-arm-vars.fd .

hdd.raw:
	qemu-img create hdd.raw 64G

focal-desktop-arm64.iso:
	curl -O https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/focal/daily-live/current/focal-desktop-arm64.iso

/opt/homebrew/bin/qemu-system-aarch64:
	brew install knazarov/qemu-virgl/qemu-virgl
```

Be mindful this Makefile could break any moment that it doesn't sync with upstream.

_Do `make install` and `make run` if you still want to try it out._

## Issues

When I first followed the guide from [the repo](https://github.com/knazarov/homebrew-qemu-virgl), I got this error.

```
qemu-system-aarch64: invalid accelerator hvf
```

The strange things were:
- no issues related to this one were registered in the Github repo.
- homebrew chose Catalina bottle instead of Big Sur

Later I realized that my brew process was not running on M1 natively but on Rosetta 2.
I digged for why and I concluded that it's because parent processes (terminal and shell, etc.) were running on Rosetta because they were installed via Nix which was running on Rosetta as well.

## Resolution

I'm new to `arch` command and it was definately helpful to figure out which arch the shell process was running at the moment.

```bash
$ arch # running this will give you probably one of these
arm64
i386
amd64
```

In my own specific case, I fixed this via [this commit](https://github.com/ryuheechul/dotfiles/commit/2ddf526e476184931ac5896857f3fa50a732c6ca) and re-did `brew install knazarov/qemu-virgl/qemu-virgl`.

No more `hvf` related error since `qemu-virgl` is installed for M1 instead for Intel one.

Thanks to all these tools I was able to run Linux on M1. It also my first time running Linux on arm64.
It seems to work fine and the speed is really fast as well.

I didn't bother to connect SSH in a traditional host and guest way.
Instead I just used https://tailscale.com/ to flatten the network and I was able to SSH to the linux VM.

This VM became totally frozen two times so far:
- once with the installation
- once a web page with firefox.

I speculate that it's probably relate to handling graphics so I will try to avoid using the UI.

But other than that even playing youtube video was working totally fine with the video and the sound and everything!

I don't know about you but it's my first time using qemu as well didn't have much experiences of super fast VMs before.
So honestly this is super impressive performance. I can guess that people might think that I'm running this ubuntu natively when it's running on a fullscreen mode.

I will probably just use it as a "headless" via SSH though, since that's fine with me most of the time.
